A Memo is a non-indexed set of Workflow Execution metadata that users supply and that a Filtered List displays.
Use Memos to define metadata supplied by users in a Filtered List.

The primary purpose of using a memo is to enhance the organization and management of Workflow Executions.
Add your own metadata, such as notes or descriptions, to a Workflow Execution, which lets you annotate and categorize Workflow Executions based on user-defined criteria.
This feature is particularly useful when dealing with numerous Workflow Executions because it facilitates the addition of context, reminders, or any other relevant information that aids in understanding or tracking the Workflow Execution.
